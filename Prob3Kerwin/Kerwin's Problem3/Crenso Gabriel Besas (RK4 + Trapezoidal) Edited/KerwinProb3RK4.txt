1.)
a.) Mass Density is simply density. It is the amount of mass or amount of material present
in a given volume. In this case, what is being referred to is the density of the metal plate.

b.) Specific heat is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a particular
material in relation to its mass. In the case of the problem, it would take 900 joules to raise
the temperature of 1 kg of the plate by 1 kelvin.

c.) Radiative emissivity is the measure of effectiveness of an object to release its energy through
radiation. In the problem, we are concerned with the amount of heat being emitted to the surroundings.

d.) The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is the proportion between the temperature and the amount of energy
being released. This covers the release of energy through other wavelengths.

e.) Josef Stefan is a Austrian physicist who is best known for Stefan's Law which relates the total
radiation emitted by an object to its temperature. Ludwig Boltzmann is his student and together
they were able to extend the law to include other types of objects, thus creating the Stefan-Boltzmann
law.

f.) The symbol for T_infinity is a good symbol since as time goes on, the temperature of the plate
should eventually reach ambient temperature.

2-3.) The graph generated using RK4 does look similar to the given graph, however the downward slope
does not seem to be as deep.
